Hello,my name is Nikolay Shishkin.

0:00:03.470,0:00:07.589
I want to make video about blockchain technology.

0:00:07.589,0:00:10.540
So what exactly is blockchain?

0:00:10.540,0:00:19.070
Before we start, we should understand how
an application works.

0:00:19.070,0:00:23.100
Any application, whether it is a Facebook,
WhatsApp or any mobile banking app, has a

0:00:23.100,0:00:25.180
front-end which interacts with the user, and
back-end, which stores the data of the user.

0:00:25.180,0:00:29.440
This back-end is called database.

0:00:29.440,0:00:37.679
Now this technique is being usedever since
first application was build.

0:00:37.679,0:00:44.079
Over internet application talks to database,
shows it to users, gets data from users and

0:00:44.079,0:00:47.579
stores it in database and so on.

0:00:47.579,0:00:50.449
This is called Centralized Data Base Approach.

0:00:50.449,0:00:58.039
Now most of things are being done online,
whether it is banking or shopping or communication.

0:00:58.039,0:01:03.890
But have you ever wondered, why we still cant
do some things online, like voting for example?

0:01:03.890,0:01:11.270
Problem is, If you don�t know what` going
on behind the scenes, how can you trust results

0:01:11.270,0:01:18.480
of election, you do don�t know if someone
can modify these results or not.

0:01:18.480,0:01:24.620
Wouldn�t it be great, if you could, for
example vote online while being sure what

0:01:24.620,0:01:28.600
your vote is actually being counted?

0:01:28.600,0:01:33.820
This wasn�t possible until few year but
now blockchain makes it possible.

0:01:33.820,0:01:36.740
With blockchain technology you don�t need
to trust any third party.

0:01:36.740,0:01:38.120
It removes trust factor, required in such
transactions.

0:01:38.120,0:01:48.530
But when who will keep the records of my transactions
and who will approve my transaction and say

0:01:48.530,0:01:52.260
what they are really genuine.

0:01:52.260,0:01:58.860
In blockchain, common users like me and you,
will do this job.

0:01:58.860,0:02:06.450
They just see the transaction and it authenticity
and then approve or reject it.

0:02:06.450,0:02:11.319
You can think of blockchain as a database
which is open to everyone and anyone can verify

0:02:11.319,0:02:13.519
what data Is present in it.

0:02:13.519,0:02:20.580
Think of it like eBay platform � when you
have to buy something from seller on eBay,

0:02:20.580,0:02:25.780
how do you decide if seller trustworthy or
not?

0:02:25.780,0:02:35.939
You check the reviews and rating given by
other people and then decide whether the seller

0:02:35.939,0:02:39.099
is authentic or not.

0:02:39.099,0:02:45.829
Here eBay can be considered as a central authority.

0:02:45.829,0:02:55.790
EBay might tell you that the seller is good,
but chances are you might not trust eBay because

0:02:55.790,0:03:03.730
that seller might have influenced eBay, this
is a problem with centralized approach.

0:03:03.730,0:03:11.010
But when you see thousands of peers just like
you and me who gave five-star rating to the

0:03:11.010,0:03:14.420
seller, you know what this seller is authentic.

0:03:14.420,0:03:16.870
This is called distributed approach.

0:03:16.870,0:03:24.129
Here you don�t need to blindly trust the
seller as you can see other peers who have

0:03:24.129,0:03:25.430
approved the seller.

0:03:25.430,0:03:30.689
Blockchain kind of works in similar way.

0:03:30.689,0:03:39.249
Instead of saving data at a single central
location it stores data in different computers

0:03:39.249,0:03:42.300
across the globe which is called nodes.

0:03:42.300,0:03:49.000
It uses a technology which makes sure all
the data remain in sync with each other.

0:03:49.000,0:03:52.680
Whenever a new data has to be added in, it
is copied across the nodes.

0:03:52.680,0:04:00.209
Now here is the core of how this technology
works.

0:04:00.209,0:04:13.180
When new transaction comes, which has to be
added in the blockchain database, they don�t

0:04:13.180,0:04:15.849
just get out by anyone.

0:04:15.849,0:04:23.750
Instead people or nodes across the globe compete
with each other to add the data into the database

0:04:23.750,0:04:27.040
by solving mathematical puzzle.

0:04:27.040,0:04:31.870
This process of finding solution to the puzzle
is called mining.

0:04:31.870,0:04:39.930
Everyone has to show a proof of work in order
to be eligible to add their block into the

0:04:39.930,0:04:40.930
database.

0:04:40.930,0:04:46.010
The one, who first solves mathematical puzzle
has opportunity to add their block into blockchain

0:04:46.010,0:04:47.010
database.

0:04:47.010,0:04:56.050
Others just verify if the person has found
correct answer and then update their own version

0:04:56.050,0:04:58.379
of blockchain database.

0:04:58.379,0:05:05.960
Any fraud or invalid data is rejected and
never added to the blockchain.

0:05:05.960,0:05:14.139
This approach makes blockchain technology
hacking-proof.

0:05:14.139,0:05:21.710
In order to solve this puzzle one must have
really fast computer.

0:05:21.710,0:05:27.610
The computer should be able to make thousands
and thousands combinations per second in order

0:05:27.610,0:05:29.300
to solve the puzzle quickly.

0:05:29.300,0:05:36.400
With hundreds of thousands computers across
the network trying to solve the puzzle together,

0:05:36.400,0:05:44.840
it becomes extremely hard to a hacker to hack
the system because to do so you need more

0:05:44.840,0:05:50.710
power than most powerful computers on the
Earth.

0:05:50.710,0:05:58.860
This explains, why hacker cant add invalid
data to the database, but with blockchain

0:05:58.860,0:06:07.819
being open database which everyone can see
what is stored and what is going on, why cant

0:06:07.819,0:06:11.199
a hacker just modify existing data?

0:06:11.199,0:06:20.180
Or, if we take our voting example, if everyone
can see who voting whom it would be a not

0:06:20.180,0:06:21.400
good thing?

0:06:21.400,0:06:29.080
And if anyone can add new data, cant I just
go and add my own fake data?

0:06:29.080,0:06:33.099
Who will prevent me from doing that?

0:06:33.099,0:06:37.750
Here is how blockchain solves tihs
All the transactions listed on blockchain

0:06:37.750,0:06:43.389
are completely anonymous, all you can see
is data being exchanged between IDs which

0:06:43.389,0:06:45.750
is also called �public key�.

0:06:45.750,0:06:54.819
There is no way to identify a person from
public key.You can think about it as a set

0:06:54.819,0:06:55.870
of lockers.

0:06:55.870,0:06:59.490
With public key you identify your locker,
and with private key you can open it.

0:06:59.490,0:07:12.469
Same as with real keys, you can give your
public key to anyone, because they cant access

0:07:12.469,0:07:15.340
your info without private key.

0:07:15.340,0:07:17.450
Why this system cant be hacked?

0:07:17.450,0:07:25.060
Why cant someone just break the locker and
take or change information stored in it?

0:07:25.060,0:07:31.720
Blockchain designed in such a way, what hacking
or changing data incorrectly is almost impossible.

0:07:31.720,0:07:38.889
Imagine stack of blocks like this with each
block containing some information.

0:07:38.889,0:07:48.789
Now, every block in the stack is linked to
the other block, so in this example yellow

0:07:48.789,0:07:52.550
block linked to the bottom red block and top
blue block.

0:07:52.550,0:07:57.610
The top red sphere is linked to the purple
block, so if for example you try to change

0:07:57.610,0:08:01.050
purple block you need only to remove red block.

0:08:01.050,0:08:09.760
But if you try to change yellow block, you
need to work your way down from red sphere

0:08:09.760,0:08:11.670
through all stack.

0:08:11.670,0:08:19.110
And notice, what miners are continuously building
these blocks on top of each other, so the

0:08:19.110,0:08:22.560
hacker has to be really fast.

0:08:22.560,0:08:27.759
In real world, blocks looks like something
like this.

0:08:27.759,0:08:35.500
Each block has a link to previous block and
they a linked with each other, forming chain

0:08:35.500,0:08:38.760
of blocks(that is why technology called blockchain).

0:08:38.760,0:08:44.700
Each block contains several transaction informations,
this is called the ledger.

0:08:44.700,0:08:54.050
Now even if someone manages to change a block
and add some incorrect information in it then

0:08:54.050,0:08:55.050
what?

0:08:55.050,0:09:03.470
This is where the concept of distributed ledger
comes in.

0:09:03.470,0:09:10.640
Each of blockchain stack or ledgers is distributed
across the nodes all over the world.

0:09:10.640,0:09:18.940
If anyone tries to change the block in any
of the ledgers it immediately would be visible

0:09:18.940,0:09:24.980
to all the other ledges because it would not
match with them.

0:09:24.980,0:09:28.600
And fraudulent data would never come into
blockchain database.

0:09:28.600,0:09:33.029
This is how blockchain technology works.

0:09:33.029,0:09:43.079
Now there is some more deep concepts in blockchain,
but this was high-level overview of this technology.

0:09:43.079,0:09:45.670
My name is Nikolay Shishkin, thank you for
watching.
